# 120 Day Data Analytics Challenge_Day-3
## Day 3 – Project Gap Analysis

### Overview

Today’s task was to revisit past work and identify gaps. Instead of building something new, I compared:

* One of my first data analytics projects
* A recent project: Sales Performance Analysis

The goal was to evaluate both projects against the five stages of the data analytics process:

1. Defining the questions (objectives)
2. Collecting the data
3. Cleaning the data
4. Analyzing the data
5. Sharing the results


### Observations

#### Early Project

* No clearly defined business questions
* Analysis was not tied to specific objectives
* Visuals existed, but there was no structured narrative
* Limited documentation of cleaning or transformation steps

At the time, it felt complete. Looking back, it lacked direction and intent.

#### Recent Project – Sales Performance Analysis

* Clear business questions defined upfront
* Data cleaning and preparation were intentional
* Analysis aligned with measurable objectives
* Visuals supported specific insights
* Results were structured around business impact

This project follows the full analytics workflow more closely.

### Key Gap Identified

The main gap is communication.

While the technical process has improved, presenting insights clearly and confidently — especially for non-technical stakeholders — is an area that still needs work. 
Good visualization is important, but effective communication determines whether insights are understood and acted upon.

### Reflection

This exercise showed that progress is not just about learning new tools. It is about improving structured thinking and intentional problem-solving.

Next focus: strengthening the communication and storytelling aspect of analytics projects.
